	- src/Board.* : clean-up, tweaking, etc.

2006-10-02 : toward version 2.1.9
	- disabled making target 'archive_bin_static' in target 'archive'. It
	ends up in error, I don't know why and it breaks target 'archive'.
	- bumped up version number in Slackware/ngstar.SlackBuild
	- updated copyright notices.

2006-05-23 : toward version 2.1.9
	- Fixed compilation with fltk-2.0.x > r5132

2006-02-05 : toward version 2.1.8
	- Ncurses_UI : added option to use 'black & white' display :
	  in ~/.ngstar/config :
		black_and_white = 0 or 1 (false or true)
	  command-line argument -b --black-and-white
	- Ncurses_UI : display the board before displaying score or
	  levelset end's message

2006-01-03 : toward version 2.1.8
	- small optimizations in drawing methods

2005-11-15 : toward version 2.1.8
	- Ncurses_UI : nice looking panel at the end of a level to display score.
	- Ncurses_UI : nice looking panel at the end of a levelset to summurize.

2005-11-13 : toward version 2.1.8
	- Board.hh : Began to implement something to make a transition
	between levels as well as to inform the player of her
	score. Problem getting it to be displayed... :/
	- Makefile : make dynamic binaries archive before static binaries
	one.
	- Board.cc : typo in load_textures()

2005-10-28 : toward version 2.1.7
	- Changed FSF address.
	- compilation output looks prettier (inspired by fltk2 makefile ;) )

2005-10-22 : toward version 2.1.7
	- Fixed bug in Fltk2_UI.cc : controls weren't refreshed when
	changing level using vi_levels.

2005-10-10 : toward version 2.1.7
	- Rearranged controls, level indicator, output of number of moves
	and gifts don't change but are relocated in the second
	line. Others controls are re-implemented in a menu, 'Exit' and
	'Restart level' are under the File menu entry, levelsets and
	themes' lists become menu entries too, and a 'Help' entry is added
	with sub-entries 'License' and 'About'.
	- Added an 'Show scores' entry under the 'File' menu to display
	current levelset's scores.
	- LevelMaker_UI : removed 'Help'->'Help' entry, useless, you'd
	better read the README file.
	- strip binary

2005-10-06 : toward version 2.1.6
	- made headers and static & shared libraries installation optional
	- added --install-dev switch to ./configure (default: no) (see above)
	- added --enable-debug switch to ./configure (default: no)
	- added --enable-static switch to ./configure (default: no)
	- modified 'make archive' to build separate archives for static
	and dynamic binaries archive.
	- during compilation use static library by default.
	- shared library is not built unless ./configure is called
	with --install-dev switch
	- modified Slackware/ngstar.SlackBuild to avoid messing up with
	ownership and permissions in doinst.sh. Do that when building
	packages so that if there's some problem only the packager's
	system is messed up, the end-user should get a clean, *working*
	package. (Big thanks to the qemu (http://www.qemu.org) programmers
	for saving my system ;))
	- typos and corrections in README
	
2005-10-02 : toward version 2.1.6
	- Cleaned {src,libngstar2}/Makefiles by letting implicit rules do
	their job.
	- moved ngstar.SlackBuild into its own Slackware directory to tidy
	up.

	- removed compilation.conf, included in ./configure
	- added tooltips on radio buttons in editor
	- cosmetic changes in showing license in editor

	when it's called without arguments everything is ready to compile.
	- reformatted --help message in ./configure
	- added --{with,without}-{fltk2,ncurses} options to ./configure
	- by default if you disable fltk2 in ./configure editor is not
	built unless you ask for it explicitly with --enable-editor
	- typo in ./configure --help
	- typo in src/Fltk2_UI.cc
	
2005-09-18 : toward version 2.1.5
	- configure script now print what has been configured
	- typo in configure
	- adjust permissions when installing
	- set the right ownership & strip binaries in ngstar.SlackBuild

2005-08-30 : toward version 2.1.5
	- changed score calculus : nbMoves*100 + nbSeconds. The _lower_
	the better.

2005-08-20 : version 2.1.4
	- added a Slackware's package creation script : ngstar.SlackBuild
	USAGE : Be sure to have in the same directory
	ngstar-<version>-src.tar.bz2 and ngstar.SlackBuild , then edit 
	ngstar.SlackBuild to edit VERSION=<version>. Then, as root, execute the
	script. The created package is created in /tmp/
	- new method EditorBoard::clear(  ) that LevelMaker_UI calls instead
	of doing the job itself. Thus harcoded char values of cells are in less
	files
	- #define's for cells' char values in libngstar2/tools.hh	
	- compilation.conf : fixed application name (ngstar instead of ngstar2)
	- tools.cc : count_file_in_dir skipfiles which filenames ends with ~

	- fixed a typo in Exceptions.hh to print the strings and not their
	address in memory
	
2005-08-11 : version 2.1.2
	- Scores almost finished, just need to find a good way to compute
	score from nb_moves & duration to complete level.
	- got rid of all those Cish malloc()s
	- now fltk2 gui & level editor windows are resizable

2005-08-10 : version 2.1.1
	- moved levelsets & themes in datas dir
	- now EditorBoard inherit from Board
	- you now can create levelsets from the level editor. They're created
	  as $HOME/.ngstar/levelsets/<new_levelset> so you must have a valid
	  $HOME/.ngstar before.
	- building leveleditor don't depend on building fltk2 gui
	
2005-08-09 : version 2.1.0
	- release time

2005-08-08 : version 2.1.0-RC1
	- LevelMaker fully functionnal
	- added NGStar2::load_level( const char *filename ) for LevelMaker
	- merged LevelMaker in the all-in-one binary ( => src/ ).
	Run ngstar-editor(_static) to use it.

2005-08-07 : version 2.0.0-RC2
	- fine-tuned mouse click position 

2005-08-05 : version 2.0.0-RC2
	- libngstar2/NGStar2.hh : made set_cell() public for the level editor
	- began working on level editor (LevelMaker)

	lost focus then got it again

2005-08-05 : version 2.0.0-RC1
	- use $HOME/.ngstar instead of $HOME/.ngstar2 to be compatible with
	NGStar(1).
	- release time :)

2005-08-03/04 : version 2.0.0-RC1 or How can a sleepless night in the heat of
		Hanoï can greatly improve your productivity (assuming you have
		near nothing left to read and foreign language bookshops are
		next to none in the town, you've watched all your DVDs, only
		programming save you from boredom)
	- ncurses gui : moved main loop into Ncurses_UI::run()
	- moved the two GUIs into one binary. Which one is showed is
	determined at runtime by looking at the name of the command (argv[0]).
	The test look for either "fltk" or "x" or "X" in the name to determine
	if the fltk2 gui is to be runned. If neither is found then if compiled
	in it run the ncurses gui.
	- Themes and levelsets are searched in $PREFIX/share/ngstar2/ and
	$HOME/.ngstar/ and ./ . In fltk2 gui all themes and levelsets found in
	these three places are put in the corresponding ComboBox.
	- updated README
	- added destructor to NGStar2 to free NGStar2::board
	- fixed fltk2 gui static compilation (at least it works for me)
	- items in Fltk2_UI::l_* are now unique. Beware that if differents
	levelsets/themes have the same name only one will be available and that
	will be the first found in (in order) default/config path, then
	$HOME/.ngstar/* and finally ./ . It means that if you make your own
	theme in $HOME/.ngstar/themes/ and give it the same name that one in
	in $PREFIX/share/ngstar2/themes then yours won't be available (same for
	levelsets).
	- Fltk2_UI::l_levelsets & Fltk2_UI::l_themes properly showing current
	value.
	- Board & Fltk2_UI : fixed late refresh controls.
	- fixed a bug in Configuration::set_theme : wouldn't set themes_path
	to the new found value.
	- if $HOME/.ngstar don't exist Configuration no longer try to create a
	default one (code is buggy and this behaviour is a bit too intrusive
	anyway). Thus, $HOME/.ngstar become optional.
	- added the option -c / --create-default-config. When called it will
	create a $HOME/.ngstar/ with default values in config, empty
	levelsets/ (and empty themes/ if fltk2 gui was compiled).
	- fltk2 gui now handled ngstar2 exceptions.
	- disabled making ngstar2.fltk2_static since it's broken.
	- fixed bug in NGStar2::read_*_level. now it throw an exception if
	the level file is shorter than expected.
	- I don't remember exactly when I did it but make install now use a
	DESTDIR variable.
	- fixed a typo in configure causing Makefile.config to grow over and
	over.
	- fixed DESTDIR / PREFIX / prefix so make install works
	- Board.cc : redraw the board before showing the end-of-levelset
	message.
	- fixed a typo in libngstar2/Makefile that made make static fail if
	make clean was called just before
	- replaced {Configuration,NGStar2}::DEBUG_* by overloading operator<<
	- fixed bug in Configuration : always started at level 1

2005-08-02 : version 0.4.0

	- code make-up in libngstar2

2005-07-20 : NGStar2 version 0.1.0
	- started a separate project for NGStar2 including fltk2 gui and
